# DefinedBot
My personal bot for Screeps: World.

## Warning

⚠️**This repo is not meant to be updated for the time being! I don't have much time doing this now!**

## Goal

DefinedBot is designed to be a user-friendly semiautomatic bot for Screeps: World.

As many bots or AIs are designed to be nearly fully-automatic, I don't think it's always suitable. As
a **game**, players **ought to** controll it for more interesting parts, for example, launch a nuke or
send a squad to invade a remote room, etc. Short and simple console commands should be provided, such
as:
```javascript
Empire.command('a room name').launchNuke('destination room');   // launch a nuke
Empire.command('a room name').sendSquad('destination room');    // send a squad
Empire.command('a room name').attackPower('destination room', 20, 20);  // attack a power bank
...
```
The bot is unfinished, and may not update quickly.
